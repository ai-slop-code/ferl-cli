# Part 11 execution checklist and acceptance gap matrix

This matrix is the final release audit companion to the exact per-scenario test
references in [`spec/implementation/acceptance-map.md`](../spec/implementation/acceptance-map.md).
The business specification and checked-in OpenAPI remain normative. “Existing
proof” names only executable evidence inspected in the baseline; “Part 11
closure” identifies evidence that the earlier gates did not supply. Passing is
recorded only after the commands in the final column have run.

## Execution checklist

1. Verify main/Part 10 ancestry, clean index/tree, identity, branches, remotes,
   worktrees, and pending operations; create/resume the Part 11 branch.
2. Audit production source, schema v2 migrations, locked dependencies, scripts,
   test fixtures, and current operator documentation. Keep PostgreSQL fixture
   operations under the existing process/interprocess harness locks.
3. Run real A/B/C production executables against the same isolated PostgreSQL
   schema for concurrent HTTP allowances, independent analytics, authority,
   queued-event deletion, drain, and replacement. Use observed database locks
   and captured queue metrics, not delays, to establish ordering.
4. Validate the entire checked-in OpenAPI 3.1 file using its pinned upstream
   schema, compile all JSON Schema 2020-12 roots, resolve references, compare
   all 22 operation IDs/methods/paths, and probe actual production HTTP behavior.
5. Run the pinned NGINX proxy over TCP with separate static files; record
   container-to-host and container-to-container peer addresses before setting
   proxy trust; traverse actual maximum header-derived report cursors.
6. Build a locked Linux release package, verify its files/provenance/checksums,
   and use that packaged binary for explicit migrate/bootstrap, HTTP smoke,
   deletion, natural shutdown, and restart without reseeding.
7. Run the full Rust/PostgreSQL/process/Collector gate and the separate release
   gate locally; record platform/image/tool versions, counts, durations, artifact
   hashes, and sanitized captures.
8. Replace historical/generic acceptance pointers with exact executable tests,
   review the full diff, commit the verified part and handoff, then perform the
   explicit no-ff local merge.

## Observed local results — 2026-10-29

| Command | Observed result |
|---|---|
| `sh scripts/check.sh` | Passed on the feature implementation before its one-line NGINX version-comment correction: **224 all-target tests plus 3 doctests**, 0 failures and 0 ignored. It ran formatting, locked check/Clippy/tests, doctests, and the independent-process/proxy/release-smoke suites. |
| `sh scripts/check-openapi.sh` | Passed on verified implementation `95d053d70c47c7199cfbd45545fa8c08b8d945d1`: 3 tests, 0 failures/ignored. |
| `sh scripts/check-proxy.sh` | Passed on clean source at `95d053d70c47c7199cfbd45545fa8c08b8d945d1`: 1 production TCP proxy test, 0 failures/ignored; clean-source package provenance verified. |
| `sh scripts/check-release.sh` | Passed on clean source at the same revision: 5 tests (3 OpenAPI, 1 proxy, 1 packaged release smoke), 0 failures/ignored. |

The host was macOS with Podman 6.1.4, PostgreSQL 17.6, Rust/Cargo 1.99.1,
NGINX 1.30.6, and the digest-pinned Debian Bookworm Rust 1.99.1 builder. The
locally built artifact targets `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`; this is not evidence
for other operating systems or architectures. The final ignored local artifact
is `target/release-packages/ferl-server-0.1.0-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz`,
SHA-256
`07d7641e88e852d6891b459c7dbd18f7d0a1db7f0b23850418d7b22718ab5d17`. Its
provenance records source revision `95d053d70c47c7199cfbd45545fa8c08b8d945d1`,
`source_tree_clean=true`, 17 inventoried files, OpenAPI SHA-256
`45677d0d0c0afda4687fada791ce492682ad546f2fbc612113890cffecbb6b5e`, and
binary SHA-256
`76fb42bffd1e224c616b87ca19b22ec52201e9fe101d4a7954a247bab3c32919`.

The macOS host-gateway probe observed backend peer `127.0.0.1`; it was not added
to the trusted-proxy list. On the isolated Podman network the observed NGINX
peer was `10.89.0.4`, direct untrusted peer `10.89.0.3`, and NGINX-observed
client peer `10.89.0.6`; the effective forwarded IP matched the latter. The
harness removed its owned proxy/server containers and network; the pre-existing
PostgreSQL fixture remains running.

All 51 scenario rows in `spec/implementation/acceptance-map.md` point to exact
executable evidence. Hosted CI was not run. Rust 1.94 compilation and an
end-to-end TLS handshake were not run and are not claimed. The full-gate
pre-correction package hash is intentionally not presented as a release
artifact; only the clean-source checksum above is the final local package
evidence.

## Post-release hardening verification — 2026-10-29

This is a new bounded hardening milestone on top of the historically complete
Part 11 baseline. The implementation revision is
`9755fb61a42fa8d328ca5723a0cec1927afe0541` on
`maintenance/post-release-hardening`, based on Part 11 merge
`6038cbe6703ed81e387b7d9fa5998e686bedcd21`. No business/OpenAPI contract or
migration was changed.

### Demonstrated defects and fixes

- The OpenAPI gate tested missing operation responses only on a negative fixture,
  accepted any documented status (including 404) for its route probes, and
  synthesized `Cache-Control` in a 405 header map. It also overwrote `$schema`,
  which could hide an unsupported dialect and destroy boolean Schema Object
  semantics. The normative document now passes the actual required-response
  helper; route probes require the precise unauthenticated result, including a
  seeded real GET/HEAD redirect; received response headers are validated as
  received. Dialects and local `$ref` targets are checked, boolean schemas
  preserve allow/deny semantics, and negative controls cover these cases. The
  former `$dynamicRef` check established pointer existence only, not dynamic
  scope/anchor behavior; the verification-integrity closure now rejects that
  keyword explicitly rather than claiming semantic support.
- The proxy test reused the same published port for its peer-observation probe
  and the later trusted-proxy replacement, then initially sent probe traffic to
  the replacement port before it was started. It now allocates three distinct
  host ports and directs each phase to its own NGINX instance. Observed peer
  addresses remain the basis for trust configuration.
- The native Ubuntu x86_64 build path did not use the Bookworm builder even
  though the packaged executable was smoked in that runtime. In addition,
  Podman selected the wrong architecture when only the other child of a local
  multi-architecture image was present. The build/runtime now select separate
  digest-pinned Debian Bookworm child manifests for arm64 and amd64, pass an
  explicit platform, and verify Debian Bookworm, Rust/Cargo 1.99.1, and the
  target triple inside the builder. Packaging refuses a dirty checkout or a
  revision override that differs from HEAD; the verifier requires exact release
  inventory, migration paths, source OpenAPI bytes, provenance, checksums, ELF
  target, and archive payload/extraction consistency. Three focused Python
  regression controls reject a mismatched archive payload, unsafe paths, and
  forged source-revision metadata.
- A full-suite run exposed that the TLS fixture waited for PostgreSQL readiness
  over its Unix socket before the packaged client connected over TCP. Readiness
  now waits for the loopback TCP listener used by the client, and a failure
  reports only the migration command's sanitized category.

### Historical test-count correction

The hardening handoff's “228 all-target tests plus 3 doctests” double-counted
the doctest result line: its displayed 228 aggregate included the separately
reported 3 doctests. Listing-only controls at retained implementation
`9755fb61a42fa8d328ca5723a0cec1927afe0541` ran
`cargo test --locked --workspace --all-targets -- --list` (97 library, 0
binary, 128 integration cases across 52 integration binaries) and
`cargo test --locked --workspace --doc -- --list` (3 doctests). This verifies
the corrected **225 all-target cases plus 3 doctests (228 distinct cases)**.
These commands enumerate but do not execute tests. The original hardening raw
gate log is not retained—the evidence directory has the package and repackages
only—so original pass/fail and ignored status cannot be independently
re-established. The historical completion remains intact; new execution results
are recorded in the verification-integrity closure below.

### Commands and results

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `sh scripts/check-openapi.sh` | Passed: 3 tests, 0 failures/ignored. Actual route outcomes, all 22 method/path/operation IDs, received headers, response maps, Draft 2020-12 roots, references, dialect controls, and boolean schemas are checked. |
| `sh scripts/check-proxy.sh` | Passed: 1 packaged production TCP proxy test, 0 failures/ignored. The host-gateway probe and trusted replacement use distinct host ports. |
| `sh scripts/check-release.sh` | Passed: 6 packaged Rust tests (3 OpenAPI, proxy, release smoke, TLS), 0 failures/ignored; the 3 Python release-verifier tests also passed. |
| `sh scripts/check-tls.sh` | Passed: 1 packaged TLS test. PostgreSQL `verify-full` migration/bootstrap/readiness succeeded; untrusted CA and hostname mismatch were rejected. OTLP HTTPS delivered and decoded 10 traces, 14 metrics, and 11 log records. Untrusted CA/hostname OTLP controls emitted exporter-failure diagnostics while readiness/requests succeeded and shutdown remained under the 20-second configured total bound. |
| `sh scripts/check.sh` | Historical handoff corrected below: the reported 228 test-result aggregate included the 3 doctests; do not read it as 228 all-target tests plus 3 doctests. |
| `FERL_MSRV_TOOLCHAIN_DIR=target/toolchains/rust-1.94.0 sh scripts/check-msrv.sh` | Passed using actual `rustc 1.94.0 (4a4ef493e 2026-03-02)` and `cargo 1.94.0 (85eff7c80 2026-01-15)` on `aarch64-apple-darwin`: locked workspace check `--all-targets --all-features` and locked production release build. The official Rust distribution archive SHA-256 was `9e55893e014e6aa76924b4cc244a289ad56de4d89d3721fbd5c7f497b31ea33c`. Registry cache was reused; check and release target directories were separate. |

### Clean-checkout artifact and limits

`sh scripts/check-release.sh` passed in a disposable detached worktree at the
implementation commit above, with complete Git history, retained compatibility
commit `7b19cfbd886efb8539b6cc2a8eed6bcc42e78922`, and initially absent Cargo
target directories. The existing Cargo registry cache was reused (and populated
with `cargo fetch --locked`); this was not a cold registry build. The packaged
executable ran as UID 65532 in the same pinned Debian Bookworm arm64 image used
to build it. It migrated and bootstrapped the isolated database, created/listed
a titled/tagged link, followed GET/HEAD, observed reports, rotated credentials,
deleted the link, and restarted without reseeding. The archive contained 17
verified files, including exact OpenAPI bytes and both migrations, with
`source_tree_clean=true`.

- Artifact:
  `target/hardening-evidence/9755fb6-clean-checkout/packages/ferl-server-0.1.0-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz`

- Provenance source revision: `9755fb61a42fa8d328ca5723a0cec1927afe0541`

Separate fresh target builds for this source revision used the same pinned
arm64 Bookworm builder and shared registry cache; they produced identical binary
and archive checksums. Repackaging identical inputs was byte-identical. This is
a local same-host, warm-registry measurement, not a cold-cache or cross-machine
reproducibility claim. Hosted CI was not run. The amd64 child image was pulled
by its pinned digest, but local execution under the arm64 Podman QEMU emulator
segfaulted; no x86_64 runtime result is claimed. Other runtime distributions
and hosted workflows remain unverified.

## Verification-integrity closure — 2026-10-29

Implementation `7309ea5ead2279b6ea01470c8382abed6013a177` was verified on
`maintenance/verification-integrity-closure`, based on `main`
`960f7a422f593c42383d2b8fe719ffd8aaee9ae4`. No normative contract, migration,
production business behavior, or dependency version changed.

### Findings and controls

- **Count/provenance:** hardening source inventory at `9755fb6` lists 225
  all-target cases (97 library, 0 binary, 128 integration across 52 binaries)
  and 3 doctests. This confirms the correction from “228 all-target plus 3” to
  225 + 3 distinct cases. The original hardening raw gate log was not retained,
  so original pass/fail/ignored output cannot be reconstructed; listing controls
  do not execute tests, and historical Complete status is preserved.
- **OpenAPI/routes:** `tests/openapi_release.rs` now applies one whole-document
  OAS 3.1/dialect/schema/reference/operation-response validator to the real and
  mutated documents. Supplied-document refs, nested map keywords, boolean
  schemas, conjunctive `$ref` siblings, unsupported nested dialects, and
  example payloads have focused controls. `$dynamicRef` is rejected explicitly
  because dynamic semantics are not implemented. Authorized operation probes
  distinguish handlers; Allow sets, received headers, and body bytes are exact.
- **Proxy:** the same observed NGINX container and bridge IP remain in use across
  upstream reload. The file is directory-mounted so the running process sees
  config changes. The test verifies its active config and connectivity and
  traverses exact raw paths, GET/HEAD, Location with query+fragment, maximum
  headers, unsupported methods, and every large-cursor page through termination.
- **TLS/privacy/lifecycle:** CA parsing/readability, matching DNS aliases,
  `verify-full` host/chain controls, PostgreSQL recovery brackets, and live
  Collector recovery brackets isolate the TLS negatives. Exported signals are
  meaningful, decoded, run-attributed by `service.instance.id`, and privacy
  scanned. No arbitrary settling sleep is used. Synchronous cancellation cleanup
  is covered by a controlled container/network cancellation regression that
  verifies the pre-existing Stage 01 container/volume remain unchanged.
- **Packaging:** extraction now follows full preverification; canonical paths,
  duplicates, links/special entries, directories, checksum/payload bytes,
  committed migrations/source bytes, ELF target, and build receipt are checked.
  A read-only Git-archive snapshot is verified against every committed blob
  before build. The receipt binds source tree, target, binary, invocation,
  command, and observed builder. Archive and sidecar updates and extraction
  staging are atomic. Restart smoke verifies the old key still returns 401 after
  restart, the replacement key works, the deleted code remains reserved, and no
  reseeding occurs.
- **CI/MSRV:** workflow now passes the toolchain prefix expected by the script;
  `RUSTC`, `RUSTDOC`, and Cargo are checked as 1.94.0. Rust 1.99.1 remains the
  ordinary toolchain. Hosted CI was not run.

### Post-commit commands and results

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `sh scripts/check-openapi.sh` | 3 passed, 0 failed/ignored. |
| `sh scripts/check.sh` | **226 all-target cases** (97 library, 0 binary, 129 integration across 52 binaries) + **3 doctests**; 0 failed/ignored. Formatting, locked check, Clippy, PostgreSQL, processes, Collector, proxy, release, and TLS all passed. |
| `sh scripts/check-proxy.sh` | 1 packaged production TCP test passed. Observed host gateway `127.0.0.1`, NGINX/backend peer `10.89.0.4`, direct untrusted peer `10.89.0.3`. |
| `sh scripts/check-release.sh` | 7 packaged Rust tests and 8 Python verifier controls passed; 0 failures/ignored. |
| `sh scripts/check-tls.sh` | 2 packaged TLS/lifecycle tests passed. One valid run delivered 10 traces, 14 metrics, 11 log records. |
| MSRV CI shape | Actual Rust/Cargo/Rustdoc 1.94.0 passed locked workspace `--all-targets --all-features` check and production release build on `aarch64-apple-darwin`. Local installed prefix was used because rustup is unavailable. |

The consolidated full-gate count above includes exactly one
`cargo test --workspace --all-targets` invocation and its separate
`cargo test --workspace --doc`; focused or filtered development runs are not
included. The 8 Python controls are listed separately from Rust test counts.

### Clean-checkout artifact and platform limits

The final release proof ran `sh scripts/check-release.sh` in a detached,
complete-history worktree at the exact implementation commit, with retained
legacy compatibility commit `7b19cfbd886efb8539b6cc2a8eed6bcc42e78922` reachable.
Cargo test and builder target directories were fresh; the registry cache was
reused. The 17-file package contains exact OpenAPI and both migrations (schema
v2), records `source_tree_clean=true`, and ran as UID 65532 in the same pinned
Debian Bookworm arm64 image used for its build.

Two repackages of the same binary/source/build receipt matched this archive
byte-for-byte. Independent builds in separate fresh target directories on this
same host and pinned builder also matched the binary hash. Registry cache reuse
means this is not cold-cache or cross-machine reproducibility evidence. The
available host/Podman VM is macOS/aarch64 and Linux/arm64; no native Linux/amd64
runtime verification is claimed. No hosted workflow was dispatched.

## Final verification corrections and acceptance — 2026-10-29

Parts 01–11 and the recorded maintenance milestones remain historically complete;
this bounded follow-up corrects two overstatements in the preceding
verification-integrity evidence and does not add backend behavior.

### Corrected claims and controls

- **Trusted-proxy identity (scenario 19):** the retained
  `target/verification-integrity/7309ea5/check-proxy.log` reports backend peer,
  NGINX address, persisted IP, and NGINX-observed IP all as `10.89.0.4`. That
  observation could not distinguish forwarded-client selection from ignoring
  forwarding and recording the NGINX peer. The corrected test starts an actual
  client process in a separate run-owned container on the isolated network. It
  records distinct client `10.89.0.6`, NGINX/backend peer `10.89.0.4`, and
  attacker-supplied spoof `198.51.100.240`; the proxied and direct untrusted
  visits both persist the actual client `10.89.0.6`, while an NGINX-originated
  no-XFF request after upstream reload persists peer `10.89.0.4`. The backend's
  configured trust list is inspected and contains only the observed NGINX peer.
  The same NGINX container ID/IP is checked before and after reload and through
  the assertions. The host-gateway loopback probe remains separate and untrusted.
- **Referenced JSON Schema dialects (scenario 51):** prior negative controls
  checked supplied roots and inline positions but did not call a public resolver
  with a referenced target introducing `$schema`. A resolver could check its
  supplied root, resolve references, and then have adaptation overwrite an
  unchecked target dialect. The added public-resolver controls reject an
  unsupported direct target, invalid `$schema` type, and second-hop target before
  adaptation. Supported `$ref` sibling conjunctions and referenced true/false
  schemas are preserved; examples, defaults, and constant instance values with
  schema-like members remain data. Whole-document checks also cover inline
  `example` values.
- **Proxy reload prerequisite:** the committed proxy test now asserts the reload
  command's exit status. A failed gate run exposed `scripts/proxy.sh` checking
  Podman mounts in a fixed output order; the required mounts were present but
  Podman returned them in another order. The ownership/configuration guard now
  verifies each required mount independently. The final clean-source proxy gate
  passed with the retained NGINX instance and the original bounded readiness
  deadline.

### Final local gates and separated counts

Final verified implementation revision:
`25f077f6fde044d41a665e100309e421bcdb7cb9` on
`maintenance/release-readiness-acceptance`, based on starting `main`
`487cc04749e1d391ba04a4a4d45d2afaa0b83aab`.

| Exact gate | Result | Retained evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `sh scripts/check-openapi.sh` | 4 passed; 0 failed/ignored. | `target/release-readiness/36effbe1b5e845dab684df60c98bf51e/gate-accepted-check-openapi-5048d12ae75d4989b128dddfd61f496e/` |
| `sh scripts/check.sh` | 227 all-target cases: 97 library, 0 binary, 130 integration cases across 52 integration binaries; separate `cargo test --workspace --doc`: 3 doctests. 0 failed/ignored. | `target/release-readiness/36effbe1b5e845dab684df60c98bf51e/gate-accepted-check-full-e8c3514747f14d2798d274492a708d48/` |

| `FERL_MSRV_TOOLCHAIN_DIR=<toolchain-dir> sh scripts/check-msrv.sh` | Actual Rust/Cargo/Rustdoc 1.94.0 passed the locked all-target/all-feature check and production release build on `aarch64-apple-darwin`. | `target/release-readiness/36effbe1b5e845dab684df60c98bf51e/gate-accepted-check-msrv-215ef2bb5fb74668afafd49e20852d35/` |

The focused development executions are separate and are not added to those
counts. The new referenced-schema test first failed against the old resolver
(showing all three bad references returned adapted `Ok` schemas), then passed
after correction. Eight filtered proxy-test executions were retained during
debugging (four passes/four failures); the failures exposed harness/control
issues corrected above. The final `check.sh`, dedicated proxy/release/TLS gates,
and clean-checkout run are the passing evidence for the final committed inputs.
The first committed full-gate attempt also remains preserved: warning-denied
Clippy found an unnecessary test-only clone; the narrow fix is commit
`4f4936a83107251b385806b2afaadd8cce3e2958`, and all final gates were rerun on
`25f077f`.

### Clean-checkout package and cache conditions

Clean-checkout `sh scripts/check-release.sh` passed at the exact implementation
commit in detached worktree
`/private/var/folders/rs/gbl8dx2d0072fmd6fdyr2qs40000gp/T/opencode/ferl-release-readiness-25f077f`.
The repository was not shallow (58 commits); retained legacy commit
`7b19cfbd886efb8539b6cc2a8eed6bcc42e78922` was present and an ancestor. The
release-test and Linux-builder Cargo target directories were initially absent
and isolated under the run evidence directory. The pre-existing Cargo registry
cache was reused (warm, not cold). The packaged executable was verified from the
17-file archive and ran as UID 65532 in the same pinned Debian Bookworm
`linux/arm64` image used by its builder.

These are warm-registry local measurements, not a cold-cache, cross-machine, or
bit-for-bit reproducibility claim. The disposable clean-checkout worktree has
been removed; its artifact/evidence remain under `target/release-readiness/`.

### External acceptance status

| Outcome | Status | Evidence/blocker |
|---|---|---|
| Local correction gate | **Passed**. | All required local gates, actual MSRV, and clean-checkout package/runtime passed at the verified implementation revision; local Git integration status is in `progress.md`. |
| Native CI acceptance | **Pending authorization**; not passed. | No remote is configured and neither pushing nor hosted workflow execution was authorized. Repository scripts advertise both aarch64 and x86_64 Linux targets; only native Linux/arm64 package execution is evidenced. No CI run URL exists. The intended supported architecture decision remains outstanding; no QEMU result is treated as native. |
| Staging and backup/restore acceptance | **Pending authorization**; not passed. | No approved staging environment/operations, private credential/evidence method, isolated restore target, or separate cursor-key recovery mechanism was provided. No staging, backup, restore, or production operation was performed. |

Accordingly, local verification integrity is closed after the local integration,
but this evidence does **not** establish release readiness for every advertised
platform or production readiness. See the [implementation progress handoff](../spec/implementation/progress.md#release-readiness-acceptance--worklist-recorded-before-implementation)
for the exact authorization prerequisites.

## Scenario-by-scenario gap matrix

`sh scripts/check.sh` is the consolidated gate for Rust, PostgreSQL, account,
link, discovery, analytics, independent-process, migration, Collector/privacy,
and lifecycle suites. Dedicated release gates are named in the final column.
The acceptance map contains the full names and assertion details for the
pre-existing tests referenced compactly here.
